I couldn't stand the ugly adobe PDF reader in seamonkey,
and when I found out about this, I was a bit dissapointed it wouldn't work anymore with my browser choice.
So I used this site here > http://addonconverter.fotokraina.com
And figured out the right settings to convert/make it work for the latest seamonkey.
Here is the new xpi n an upload link

Hope that's ok, I would have kept it to myself ..but this is awesome :)
